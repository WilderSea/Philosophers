This proyect is a program in C, where I have to work using threads and mutexes to simulate a dinner of philosophers, where they have to "eat, sleep and think" an specific amount of time. They must be correctly syncronized to avoid dead locks and data races. <br><br>
The bonus part is the same idea but this time using processes and semaphores to manage the resources.
